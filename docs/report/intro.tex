\section{Introduction}
We want to model the OpenWSN stack using Ptolemy II. Our goal is to provide a tool to estimate power consumption, scalability and network behavior of a WSN application in an early phase of the design process.

Once completed, this project will provide a two-fold contribution. First, it is going to augment the building blocks available to the Ptolemy community. This means Ptolemy will be used to design applications with a clear high level semantics, while being able to evaluate lower level details and their impact once the application is deployed. Second, we are providing a tool to help the OpenWSN community in the development process.
