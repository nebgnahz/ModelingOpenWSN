\label{sec:conclusion}

Work is proceeding smoothly following our previous roadmap (with minor changes). We are extending our model according to an iterative approach, which allows us to capture feedback and fix issues while improving its functionality. By the end of the month, we plan to simulate inter-node communication and time synchronization, tag each execution with a specific power consumption index.
