\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Work is proceeding smoothly following, with minor changes, our previous roadmap. We are extending our model according to an iterative approach, which allows us to capture feedback and fixing issues while extending functionalities. By the end of the month, we plan to be able to simulate inter-node communication and time synchronization, to tag each execution with a specific power consumption index and to deploy an arbitrarily large network (using Ptolemy model generation support).
