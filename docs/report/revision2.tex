\section{Revision Since Last Update}
\label{sec:revision-since-last}

Since our last presentation on the class, we have made the following progress:

\begin{itemize}
\item We modified the MAC layer finite state machine from a flat FSM to a hierarchical one, using state refinement.
\item FSM transitions are now arranged in tabular form (last version of Ptolemy required).
\item We added a basic physical layer emulator actor (DE model).
\item We are changing the implementation of the network node model from a clock-driven approach to an event-driven one (this addresses performance issues).
\item We modeled the clock drift for each node using Ptolemy multiform time support.
\end{itemize}
