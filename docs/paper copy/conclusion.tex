\label{sec:conclusion}

In this project, we modeled, using Ptolemy, part of the OpenWSN protocol stack, with an emphasis on the MAC Layer \texttt{TSCH} protocol. Though there are still many features we have not fully implement (such as packet re-transmission), our framework has already enabled some preliminary studies in particular network scenarios. We showed the time synchronization performance and power consumption estimation using a case study of a multi-hop network application.
As future work, we are planning further extensions of our model, including modeling the routing layer and advanced scheduling policies. Moreover, we are interested in a closer interaction with the OpenWSN team to realize a platform to develop Internet of Things applications.
