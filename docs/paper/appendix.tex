\section{Demos}

We have constructed two demos that can serve the purpose of understanding the time synchronization and multi-hop data transmission in OpenWSN protocol. They are named \verb+demo_multihop_dict_nopower.xml+(see Figure~\ref{fig:multihop}) and \verb+demo_sync.xml+(see Figure~\ref{fig:timesync}) in the accompanying folder with this report. Readers are welcome to open it and run it with Ptolemy II.
