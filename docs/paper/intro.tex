\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

With the \textbf{Internet of Things} enabling great applications including energy-aware homes and real-time asset tracking, we are seeing new standards defined that unifies the communication between low-cost, low-speed ubiquitous wireless devices. Specifically, IEEE 802.15.4 \cite{lan2003part} was defined in 2003 to specify the physical (PHY) layer and media access control (MAC) for low-rate wireless personal area networks (LR-WPANs). Though promising, the main MAC strategy is still CSMA/CA which is not appropriate for energy-constrained wireless sensor nodes. IEEE802.15.4e \cite{IEEE802.15.4e} is later proposed as an amendment that adopts channel hopping strategy to improve support for the industrial markets increases, robustness against external interference and persistent multi-path fading. 

OpenWSN project \cite{watteyne2012openwsn}, developed at Berkeley, is to provide an open-source implementation of the complete IEEE802.15.4e protocol stack on a variety of software and hardware platforms.

In this project, we model the OpenWSN protocol using Ptolemy \cite{davis1999overview, PtolemyVol1:04}.
