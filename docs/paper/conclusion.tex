\label{sec:conclusion}

In this project, we have explored using Ptolemy as the tool to model OpenWSN protocol with an emphasis on the MAC Layer TSCH protocol. Though there are still many features we haven't fully implement (like packet retransmission), existing framework has already enabled some prelimary study of a particular network. We showed the time synchronization performance and power consumption estimation in our case study of a multi-hop network application. For future work, we seek to use this as the platform for many interesting Internet of Things application development.
