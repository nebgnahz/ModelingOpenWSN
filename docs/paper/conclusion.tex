\label{sec:conclusion}

In this project, we modeled, using Ptolemy, part of the OpenWSN protocol stack, with an emphasis on the MAC Layer TSCH protocol. Though there are still many features we haven't fully implement (such as packet retransmission), our framework has already enabled some preliminary studies in particular network cases. We showed the time synchronization performance and power consumption estimation in our case study of a multi-hop network application. For future work, we are planning for further extensions of our model, including routing layer and advanced scheduling policies, as well as Internet of Things application development.
