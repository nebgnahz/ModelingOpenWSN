ModelingOpenWSN
===============

This project is about modeling OpenWSN protocol in Ptolemy. For CS294-97 and EE219D at Spring 2014 at Berkeley.

## Get started
1. Install Ptolemy
2. Run models in apps

## Use this repository
- `apps` contains a few apps include the demo we showed
- `docs` is where we hosted papers and presentations
- `logs` contains some traces that we have used for experiements
- `ptolemy_models` is the place we update and fix bugs for models. We tend to update at a single place and load that into `apps`.
- `Makefile` is always your friend to keep record of working flows and know what's possible.
